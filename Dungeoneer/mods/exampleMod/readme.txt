# Readme!
-----------------------

This is an example mod for delver that adds a new item with a custom spritesheet for it.

File breakdown:
  * data/items.dat - defines a new dagger, and sets up the attributes for it.
  * data/spritesheets.dat - creates a new spritesheet for the game called 'example-mod-items'
  * example-mod-items.png - The actual image used for the spritesheet defined in spritesheets.dat
  * splash/Delver-logo.png - A new custom Delver logo, to make it easy to know that the mod is loading properly.
